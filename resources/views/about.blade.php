            <p>Iâ€™m creative, but I also understand briefs and deadlines.  If that sounds like the type of person you would like to work with, contact me.</p>
            <p>As a copywriter, I specialise in innovative, voice-driven marketing. What does this mean? It means I spend time understanding the culture behind your brand, product or service, before crafting engaging copy that complies with your tone of voice.  To make my words count, I need to know what you value most.</p>
